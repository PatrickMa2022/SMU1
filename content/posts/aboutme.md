&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Patrick Ma, a senior at Jesuit College Preparatory School. I enjoy a lot of different activities including but not limited to robotics, playing the trumpet and playing sports. My favorite sport is swimming which has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My interests in mechanical engineering grown because of my involvement in robotics and my fascination with airplanes and tanks. I am the co-founder and Vice President of the Jesuit Engineering Society. I am also the Vice President of my school's FRC (First Robotics Competition) Team 2048.
