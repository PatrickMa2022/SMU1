 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best sport in the world is... swimming for a multitude of good reasons. For one, swimming is a life saving skill and it is incredibly important to know how to swim. Number two is that it is one of the most watched sports in the olympics because of names like Michael Phelps and Katy Ledecky. Swimming is easier to measure improvement, helps with endurance and is incredibly fun. It is also the only sport I have stuck with for a long time.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. According to my parents, when I was doing swim lessons as a baby I seemed to really enjoy the water so they continued the lessions. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, I watched Michael Phelps dominate every event he swam. Apparently thats when I had made up my mind that I wanted to swim competativley. I started my swimming career at Santa Clara Swim Club in California and continued to swim there until early 2011. When my time at Santa Clara ended we moved to PEAK Swimming in Saratoga, California. I continued to swim there until my family and I moved to Florida in the summer of 2012. We spent about a year and a half looking for swim clubs in my area that could match the competativeness of the two I swam for in California. We were unable to find ones that were close to home so I had to stop club swimming. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2016 I moved to a new school and they had a swim team that combined both middle school and high school. There I was able to continue my swimming career until 9th grade. I ended my 9th grade season on varsity but due to some external problems I could not continue to swim in 10th grade. During the summer of 2020 I moved to Texas and enrolled at Jesuit College Preparatory School. Here I rejoined the swim team and ended my 11th grade season on varsity. I hope that I will continue my swimming career and end my senior year on the varsity team.
