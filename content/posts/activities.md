&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whoever is reading this website, I would like to say thank you for checking this out. Since you clicked on the "Why SMU" portion of my website, you must be very interested (I hope) as to why I want to attend SMU. To start this wild adventure we first need to start all the way from the beginning (sixth grade).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sixth grade, I moved to a small school in Florida called Windermere Preparatory School. Skipping ahead a few years to 9th grade, there was a college fair that was supposed to be for sophomores and juniors. Yet, my parents really wanted me to attend so I talked to my high school counselor to see if there was a way that I could attend. Luckily there were some available spots, so my counselor was able to sign me up.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was walking into the college fair, I had no idea what to expect. It really hadn't dawned on me that college was right around the corner. I wasn't thinking about which college I wanted to attend. I knew that I wanted to study engineering, and I knew that I wanted to go to a good school in Texas. I ended up running into the SMU booth. At the time I wasn't able to pinpoint why the name was vaguely familiar so I headed over to the table to meet Mrs. Morris. Looking back at my past, I want to really thank Mrs. Morris for talking to me that day. Our conversation is what sparked my interest in SMU, and for the past four years I have had my eyes set on SMU.  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next year came, and I went back to the SMU booth at the college fair to talk to Mrs. Morris again and ask my questions. I was a little more in the college mindset so when Mrs. Morris came to our school for a college representative visit, I would sign up. She was always incredibly helpful by asnwering every single question I had and giving more insight into the college life. Especially second semester of 10th grade during the pandemic when she could not visit school. Since I was moving to Texas she put me in contact with Mr. Mu√±oz, who at the time was my admissions councilor for Jesuit Dallas, and she made sure that all of my information had been changed in the system. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The move had its difficulties, such as not being able to actually visit SMU yet or being stuck in a hotel for a semester but, I was eventually able to do an event online called SpringFest. There I got to take a virtual tour of campus and learn about engineering at Lyle. Over the summer between 11th and 12th grade, I was able to do a campus tour and also do Mustang Days. There I really got to get a feel of the campus without the students and got an in-person tour as well as an engineering seminar. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might be wondering "Why do you, Patrick, want to attend SMU for engineering?" Well, the facilities are really nice. When I toured the campus I went into Caruth Hall and the classrooms were really nice. Being able to do research as an undergraduate, much less a freshman is something that caught my attention because I wanted to work on research but I had always thought that I would have to wait until graduate school. I was also able to talk to a professor, Dr. David Willis of Mechanical Engineering, who was incredibly nice. My experience with Dr. Willis is what also drew me to SMU because he took time out of his day to sit down and answer any questions I had about Mechanical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at SMU.
